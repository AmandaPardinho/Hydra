## Why Hydra?
> This is a joke because of javascript. My first contact with this language was when I was starting my studies with programming logic classes. Needless to say, I was slightly traumatized by it. At that moment I thought I would never learn to program. Thank goodness I was wrong.
> Since then, javascript has become my personal monster. Something that I really fear to this day. But, two years later, I believe it is time to face it again. And if everything goes right (and it will), I hope to come out the winner of this fight.

## The Repository
>In this repository I intend to put projects involving HTML, CSS and, mainly, Javascript. I've been participating in some tracks that end up leading to the full stack area and, because of that, I restarted studying about it.
