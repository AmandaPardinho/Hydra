## **Why Hydra?**
> This is a joke because of javascript. My first contact with this language was when I was starting my studies with programming logic classes. Needless to say, I was slightly traumatized by it. At that moment I thought I would never learn to program. Thank goodness I was wrong.
> 
> Since then, javascript has become my personal monster. Something that I really fear to this day. But, two years later, I believe it is time to face it again. And if everything goes right (and it will), I hope to come out the winner of this fight.

## **The Repository**
> In this repository I intend to put projects involving HTML, CSS and, mainly, Javascript. I've been participating in some tracks that end up leading to the full stack area and, because of that, I restarted studying about it.

## **Abstract**
> This is the first time I have tried to replicate a site. Particularly, I have found it quite difficult and challenging. Dealing with images and colors and fonts has never been my favorite thing.
> 
> When I started in programming, I was first introduced to the more "artistic" part of it. It was only this year, when I got to know Java, that I realized why, as much as I thought it was cool to program, I never really liked the front end. I have always been the one who thinks too much, who is more rational.
>
> I believe this is why I identified much more with Java than with the front end. As much as with it I have to "create" a solution for a certain problem, this creation is much more logical than creative.
>
> However, in life we don't only do things we like. We do what needs to be done. That is why I decided to challenge myself and venture into this replication of the site. I admit that I am curious to see the final result. And I hope to realize that I can achieve more than I imagine at this point.I hope that soon I will be able to present the result of this project here.
